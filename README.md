# Coding Exercise

For this exercise you will create a simple web application that does the following:
1. Allows a user to enter their email address ([see example wireframe](wireframe-log-in.png)).
1. Allows a user to choose a card from [this list](cards.json).
2. Displays the selected card's link to the user ([see example wireframe](wireframe-cards.png)).
3. Appends an identifier to the URL to track the referrer.
4. The identifier should be an encrypted form of the users email address.

The exercise should generally not take more than a few hours, although you're free to take as much time as you'd like to work on it.

Feel free to use whatever technology stack you think is a good fit. If you prefer back end coding, then focus on that and make a simple front end, or vice versa.

To submit the exercise,

1. Deploy the application to some public location where we can interact with it (e.g. AWS S3, Heroku)
2. Push the code to GitHub or some other code hosting service (private repository please - we can give you usernames to add as collaborators), or send us an archive of your local git repository.

**Please send code that you are proud to show us!**
